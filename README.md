# Rokkit

[Rokkit](https://rokk.it) is a URL shortener built with Laravel and Livewire. It allows users to create shortened URLs that redirect like a regular link redirect, or a user can opt to create an advertisement during that redirect. Here is a [demo of an advertising redirect](https://rokk.it/demo).

Rokkit is hosted on a Cloudways managed DigitalOcean droplet, and uses the Cloudways API to add domains to SSL certs for custom domains. A more detailed look into this can be found [here](https://davidgrzyb.com/laravel-dynamic-domain-routing-cloudways).
